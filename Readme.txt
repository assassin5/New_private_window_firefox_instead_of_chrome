Made by Asza 12/07/2025 version 1.0.
Used for Autohotkey 2.0.
There is an even better way to achive the same using Firefox autoconfig (no Autohotkey) if you don't already use startup scripts.
See https://github.com/JoBuettner/firefox-autoconfig-customizations
=========================================================

The script changes CTRL+SHIFT+N to CTRL+SHIFT+P

CTRL+SHIFT+N is new private window in Chrome.
CTRL+SHIFT+P is new private window in Firefox.

This script makes it so you can use the hotkey for new private windows in Firefox if you are used to the Chrome hotkeys.

You can place the exe file in your startup folder to make it run when the computer starts. Go to Run > type "shell:startup" and place the file in this folder.
